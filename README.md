## Brady Driebergen's Example GitHub Page

Hello! This is the example page we were assigned to make in CS-HU250.

This page is hosted at BradyDriebergen.github.io

This was a fantastic project to work on and an excellent class to attend. I've learned a lot
about GitHub and I will use what I've learned in this class for the rest of my career. There are
still some topics I need to practice more but that'll come with time. I'm very happy with what
I've learned and I'm excited to see where life takes me.
